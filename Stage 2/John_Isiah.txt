I have worked on these, adding any necessary attributes and methods for each one in the UML Diagram:
Class:Gym

Class:Membership

Class:Payment

Class:Receipt

Class:Menu (I have created this class during Stage 2 to handle all the menus in our system, also added the methods needed for this)


Class:Item (I have created this class during Stage 2 to be use with the inventory class, I have also added the methods and variables needed for this, however I will not be working on this class, this will be assign to someone else to code)
