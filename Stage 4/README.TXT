How to compile our program:
Easiest way to run our program is just by clicking on .jar file this will open up the program.

The other option in case clicking on the .jar file does not work, you may use command terminal using this
java -jar "GymManagementClas.jar" this will run the program just fine.

If using either option the lib folder must be present in the same folder as it contains the necessary items for  it to run and the .txt files that works with them.

Then the last option to run the program would be to download this folder and use the command terminal again. To do this you need to open up the folder that contains the program files(.java, .form, .txt).
1. click on the file path until its highlighted then simply type 'cmd' to open the terminal to this folder
2. type javac main.java to compile everything, this part will show any errors that it comes across when trying to compile
3. If no errors occur then you type java main, to run the program
